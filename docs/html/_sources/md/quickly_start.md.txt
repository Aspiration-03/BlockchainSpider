# Quickly Start

This section will introduce how to start an Ethereum transaction spider 
with `BFS` strategy.

## Dependency
You can install modules by running on commands below in console:
```shell
pip install scrapy
pip install selenium
pip install networkx
```

## Start a BFS-based transaction spider
Using the BFS strategy to search for a subgraph with a depth of 2 from a source address, 
just run on this command in console:
```shell
scrapy crawl txs.eth.bfs \
-a source=0x3f5ce5fbfe3e9af3971dd833d26ba9b5c936f0be \
-a out=./data/bfs \
-a depth=2
```
The `-a` means add argument for spider, where:
- source: the source address of Ethereum
- out: the output directory
- depth: the BFS search depth

More configures, please see in `Tx Spider`.
