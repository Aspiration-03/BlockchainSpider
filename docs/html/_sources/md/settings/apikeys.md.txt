# APIKeys
`Tx Spider` depends on apikeys.

You can configure Apikey in a json file for spider, default is `./apikeys.json`. 
Before that, please make sure that `settings.py` contains the following statement:
```python
APIKEYS_JSON_FILENAME = './apikeys.json'
```

**Attention**: It is recommended that the number of apikeys be greater than or equal to the 
`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` in `settings.py` parameter to maximize the performance of spider.
