# Cache
The cache settings will facilitate the restart of the spiders. 
In fact, after setting the cache directory of the spiders, 
all HTTP requests will be cached in the directory, 
so that the engine can directly read the local cache when sending the same request without going through network.

Well, you can config your cache directory in `settings.py`, just like this:
```python
HTTPCACHE_DIR='/opt/cache' 
```
If you use a relative path, the cache will appear in the `.scrapy`.

**Attention**: The cache configuration is only valid for `Tx Spider` now.
